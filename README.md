# CUDA based FP-Growth Algorithm Implementation

This project is an implementation of the FP-Growth algorihm for Frequent Item Set mining using CUDA parallelism with the goal to boost its performance and apply it to large data sets.

The implementation will be based on the methods outlined in the following papers:

* Liu, L., Li, E., Zhang, Y., & Tang, Z. (2007). Optimization of frequent itemset mining on multiple-core processor. *In Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases* (pp. 1275-1285)
* Arour, K., & Belkahla, A. (2014). Frequent Pattern-growth Algorithm on Multi-core CPU and GPU Processors. CIT. *Journal of Computing and Information Technology*, 22(3), 159-169.
